**Linear inequalities** are inequalities that involve at least one linear algebraic expression, that is, a polynomial of degree 1 is compared with another algebraic expression of degree less than or equal to 1.

Performing the same operation on both sides of the inequality will result in an equivalent inequality EXCEPT when multiplying or dividing by a negative number.

**Example 1: Just one variable**

$$
\begin{aligned}
2x + 3 \leq 10 \\ \\
2x \leq 7 \\ \\
x \leq \frac{7}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

**Example 2: Two Variables**
$$
\begin{aligned}
2x + 3y + 2 > 5 \\ \\
3y > 5 - 2 - 2x \\ \\
3y > -2x + 3 \\ \\
y > \frac{-2x + 3}{3} \\ \\
y > -\frac{2}{3}x + 1
\end{aligned}

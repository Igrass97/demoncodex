In mathematics, a system of [[linear equations]] (or linear system) is a collection of one or more [[linear equations]] involving the same variables.

**Example 1**
$$
\begin{aligned}
3x + 2y - z = 1 \\
2x -2y + 4z = -2 \\
-x + \frac{1}{2}y - z = 0
\end{aligned}
$$


A general system of m [[linear equations]] with n unknowns and coefficients can be written as

$$
\begin{aligned}
a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + ... + a_{1n}x_{n} + b_1 = 0 \\
a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + ... + a_{2n}x_{n} + b_2 = 0 \\
. \\
. \\
. \\
a_{m1}x_1 + a_{m2}x_2 + ... a_{mn}x_{n} + b_m = 0
\end{aligned}
$$
## Solution Set
A solution of a linear system is an assignment of values to the variables $x1, x2, ..., xn$ such that each of the equations is satisfied. The set of all possible solutions is called the solution set.

A linear system may behave in any one of three possible ways:

1. The system has _infinitely many solutions_.
2. The system has a single _unique solution_.
3. The system has _no solution_.

### Two Variables
Each equation represents a line in the xy plane, so the solution are the intersections:
1. The intersection is a line: $\infty$ solutions
2. The intersection is a point: 1 solution
3. No intersection: No solution

### Three Variables
Each linear equation determines a plane in three-dimensional space, and the solution set is the intersection of these planes.
1. If the intersection is a single point: 1 solution
2. If the intersection is a line: $\infty$ solutions
3. If the intersection is a plane: $\infty$ solutions
4. If they don't intersect: 0 solutions

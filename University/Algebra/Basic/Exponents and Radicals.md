Exponents are a shorthand notation for repeated multiplication, and radicals are the opposite operation of applying exponents. Here are some examples:

**Example 1: Evaluating Exponents**
```
Evaluate: 2^3 
Solution: 
2^3 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8
```

**Example 2: Simplifying Radicals**
```
Simplify the radical: √(16) 

Solution: √(16) = 4
```

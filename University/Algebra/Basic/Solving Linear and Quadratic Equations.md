Linear equations have variables raised to the power of 1, while quadratic equations have variables raised to the power of 2. Let's solve some examples:

**Example 1: Solving a Linear Equation**

```
Solve for x: 3x + 5 = 11

Solution:
3x + 5 = 11
3x = 11 - 5
3x = 6
x = 6 / 3
x = 2
```

**Example 2: Solving a Quadratic Equation**

```
Solve for x: x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0 

Solution: 
Factor the quadratic expression: 
(x - 3)(x - 1) = 0 

Setting each factor to zero: 
x - 3 = 0 --> x = 3 
x - 1 = 0 --> x = 1
```

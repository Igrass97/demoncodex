Operations with real numbers involve basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Let's go through some examples:

```
Given: a = 5, b = 7, c = 3
Calculate: 2a + (b - c) * 3

Solution:
2a + (b - c) * 3 = 2 * 5 + (7 - 3) * 3 = 10 + 4 * 3 = 10 + 12 = 22
```

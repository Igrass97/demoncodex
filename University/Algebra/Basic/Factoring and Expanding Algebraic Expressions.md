Factoring involves breaking down algebraic expressions into their simpler forms, while expanding does the opposite. Let's see some examples:

**Example 1: Factoring**
```
Factor the expression: x^2 - 4 

Solution: 
x^2 - 4 = (x + 2)(x - 2)
```

**Example 2: Expanding**
```
Expand the expression: (a + b)^2 

Solution: 
(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
```

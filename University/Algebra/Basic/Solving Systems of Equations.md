A system of equations involves multiple equations with multiple variables. Let's solve a system of linear equations:

```
Solve the system:
2x + y = 8
3x - y = 4

Solution:
Add both equations to eliminate y:
2x + y + 3x - y = 8 + 4
5x = 12
x = 12 / 5

Substitute x into any equation to find y:
2(12/5) + y = 8
24/5 + y = 8
y = 8 - 24/5
y = 16/5

Therefore, x = 12/5 and y = 16/5.

A linear equation is an equation in which the highest power of the variable is always 1.

## Forms

### Standard

$$ ax + by + c = 0 $$
Where x and y are variables, a and b coefficients and c is a constant.

The graph of a linear equation always forms a straight line.

There are linear equations in one variable and linear equations in two variables.

A linear equation can be expressed in the standard form, the slope-intercept form, or the point-slope form.

The slope of a linear equation is the amount by which the line is rising or falling.

#### Get Slope
If $(x_1, y_1) \text{ and } (x_2, y_2)$ are two points in a line, the slope is calculated using:
$$m =\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$


### Slope Intercept 
$$ y = mx + c $$
 (where m = slope and c = y-intercept)

### Point slope form
$$y - y1Â = m(x - x1)$$ 
(where m = slope and (x1, y1) is a point on the line)

## In One Variable
A linear equation in one variable is an equation in which there is only one variable present.

$$ax + b = 0$$ These are the easiest to solve.

## In Two Variables
A linear equation in two variables is of the form 
$$ax + by + c = 0$$

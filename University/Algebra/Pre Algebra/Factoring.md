In mathematics, factorization or factoring consists of writing a number or another mathematical object as a product of several factors, usually smaller or simpler objects of the same kind.

## For Integers
The fundamental theorem of arithmetic, asserts that every positive integer may be factored into a product of prime numbers.

## For Polynomials
In elementary algebra, factoring a polynomial reduces the problem of finding its roots to finding the roots of the factors.

A polynomial has the following shape:

$a_{n}x^{n} + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_{2}x^{2} + a_{1}x + a_{0}$

A solution of this equation (also called a root of the polynomial) is a value r of x such that $P(x) = 0$

If $P(x) = Q(x)R(x)$ is a factorization of $P(x) = 0$, then the roots of $P(x)$ are the union of the roots of $Q(x)$ and $R(x)$

### The Factor Theorem
Asserts that, if $r$ is a root of $P(x) = 0$, then $P(x)$ may be factored as 

$P(x) = (x - r) Q(x)$

Where $Q(x)$ is the quotient of the Euclidian division of $P(x) = 0$ by the linear (degree one) factor $x – r$.

Polynomials with integer or rational coefficients have the unique factorization property.

More precisely, every polynomial with rational coefficients may be factorized in a product

$P(x) = q P_{1}(x)...P_{k}(x)$

Where $q$ is a rational number (may be expressed as a fraction) and $P_{1}...P_{k}$ are non-constant polynomials thar are irreducible and primitive.

#### Irreducible Polynomials
Polynomial that cannot be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials.

#### Primitive part and Content
In algebra, the content of a nonzero polynomial with integer coefficients is the greatest common divisor of its coefficients. The primitive part of such a polynomial is the quotient of the polynomial by its content. Thus a polynomial is the product of its primitive part and its content.

A polynomial is primitive if its content equals 1. Thus the primitive part of a polynomial is a primitive polynomial.

### Degree 2 (quadratic)

#### Greatest Common Factor
We have to find out the greatest common factor, of the given polynomial to factorize it. This process is nothing but a type of reverse procedure of distributive law, such as;

$p( q + r) = pq + pr$

But in the case of factorization, it is just an inverse process;

$pq + pr = p(q + r)$

#### Identities
- $(a + b)^{2} = a^{2} + 2ab + b^{2}$
- $(a - b)^{2} = a^{2} - 2ab + b^{2}$
- $a^{2} - b^{2}= (a + b)(a - b)$

#### Find the roots of a quadratic expression (ultimate way to factorize all quadratic expressions)

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
If $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$ are the roots of the quadratic expression, then it can be rewritten as:

$P(x) = a (x - r_{2}) (x - r_{1})$

### Degree 3 (cubic)

#### Identities
$a^{3} + b^{3} = (a + b) (a^{2} - ab + b^{2})$
$a^{3} - b^{3} = (a - b) (a^{2} + ab + b^{2})$

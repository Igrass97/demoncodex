A polynomial is an expression consisting of indeterminates (also called variables) and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and positive-integer powers of variables.

Two polynomial expressions are considered as defining the same polynomial if they may be transformed, one to the other, by applying the usual properties of commutativity, associativity and distributivity of addition and multiplication.

A polynomial in a single indeterminate _x_ can always be written (or rewritten) in the form

$a_{n}x^{n} + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_{2}x^{2} + a_{1}x + a_{0}$

The **degree** of a polynomial is the largest degree of any term with nonzero coefficient.

## Operations 

### Addition and subtraction

$P = 3x^{2} - 2x + 5xy - 2$
$Q = -3x^{2} + 3x + 4y^{2} + 8$

Then
$P + Q = (3x^{2} - 3x^{2}) + (-2x + 3x) + 5xy + 4y^{2} + (-2 + 8)$

Will result in
$P + Q = x + 5xy + 4y^{2} + 6$

### Multiplication
$P = 2x + 3y + 5$
$Q = 2x + 5y + xy + 1$
$PQ = (2x.2x) + (2x.5y) + (2x.xy) + (2x . 1) + (3y.2x) + (3y.5y) + (3y.xy) + (3y.1) + (5.2x) + (5.5y) + (5.xy) + (5.1)$
### Division (one variable)

#### **x as denominator**

**Without reminder**
$$\frac{2x^{3} + 5x^{2} + 2x}{x}$$

Result: $2x^{2} + 5x + 2$

**With reminder**
$$\frac{18x^{4} - 3x^{2} + 6x - 4}{6x}$$
Result: $3x^{3} - \frac{1}{2}x + 1 - \frac{2}{3}x^{-1}$

#### Long division

$$\frac{x^{2} + 3x + 6}{x + 1}$$
